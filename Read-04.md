# CSS 

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## There is three type :

* relative URL:

 `Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.`
 
* absolute URL:

`When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.`

* Email Links:

`To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address`
------------------------------

*If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.*


-------------------------------
## The position Property

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

There are five different position values:

- static
- relative
- fixed
- absolute
- sticky

## clear

The clear property specifies on which sides of an element floating elements are not allowed to float.

## The overflow property specifies what should happen if content overflows an element's box.

- overflow: scroll;
- overflow: visible;
- overflow: hidden;
- overflow: auto;

# javascript

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.


 - function : 
 `Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). `

- object :
 `Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. `

















 `If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:`

### `ID Attribute` :
 `Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page`

### `Class Attribute` :
`Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document`

### `Block Elements` :
`Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.

Examples of block elements are
h1, p, ul, and li.`

### `Inline Elements`:
`Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
a, b, em, and img.`

# Process & Design

### CSS Properties : 
`CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.`


### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS
