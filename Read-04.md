# CSS 

Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## There is three type :

* relative URL:

 `Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.`
 
* absolute URL:

`When you link to a different
website, the value of the href
attribute will be the full web
address for the site, which is
known as an absolute URL.`

* Email Links:

`To create a link that starts up
the user's email program and
addresses an email to a specified
email address`
------------------------------

*If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.*


-------------------------------

There are five different position values:

# javascript

Browsers require very detailed instructions about what
we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run
to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use
functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.


 - function : 
 `Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). `

- object :
 `Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names. `
