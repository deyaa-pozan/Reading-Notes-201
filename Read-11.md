# Image Css

You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box. 

The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an Image.

In these chapters, you will learn about the following CSS background properties:


* background-image

`The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.`

 --------------------------- 

* background-repeat
`The background image is
repeated both horizontally and
vertically (the default way it
is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).`

 --------------------------- 

* background-attachment
`The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.

`

 --------------------------- 

* background-position
`The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.

* background (shorthand property)

`The background property acts
like a shorthand for all of the
other background properties
you have just seen, and also the
background-color property.`

2: background-image
3: background-repeat
4: background-attachment
