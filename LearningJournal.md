 ### * 5 Main Differences * 

 * Learning behavior.
 
 - `Adult learners are self directed; they have control over their     learning experience and they are 100% responsible for their own learning`

 - `young learners are not self-directed; they still depend on their teachers throughout the learning process`

 * The role of learners’ experience.
 `Adult learners have clearly more experience than young learners. Their experience becomes the main resource of both their learning and the personal identity they have developed, as the richer and more diverse their experience, the more the diversity they can bring to their own learning. Young learners, on the other hand, present little personal experience by default, and so it is impossible for this experience to serve as a learning resource; it can be only used to build upon.`

 * Orientation to learning.
 `adult learners seek information that is useful in their personal lives and work environment,
 Young audiences learning, on the contrary, is subject centered, mearning that the subject determines the sequence according to which the learning content units will be presented and taught.`

 * Readiness to learn. 
 `Adult learners’ readiness to learn can be triggered by literally anything; a sudden change in their lives, a need for dealing with life tasks and problems more successfully, the desire for self-improvement and self-development, and so on. Adults need to know why to learn something; as soon as they answer this question, they are ready to start. Children, on the other hand, are usually told what to learn; the reason behind their learning is developing their skills to achieve the next level of mastery.`

 * Motivation for learning.
 - `adults is mostly motivated mostly intrinsic motivators; self-esteem, self-confidence, desire for better quality of life, curiosity, self-development, and recognition are only a few factors that motivate adult learners to learn.`

 - ` children and teenagers are mostly motivated by extrinsic factors, such as getting good grades or other perks, or avoiding the consequences of failure.`
