## CSS image

A picture can say a thousand words, and great
images help make the difference between an
average-looking site and a really engaging one.


*Adding Images*

`<img src="url" alt="alternatetext" title = "description">`

***The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.***

### The <img> tag has three required attributes:
- src : Specifies the path to the image
- alt : Specifies an alternate text for the image
- title : provide additional information  about the image

### Height & Width of Images


- height : This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
- This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

### Image Resolution
***Images created for the web should be saved at
a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution
of the image, the larger the size of the file.***

## CSS color 

***The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:***

- rgb values
- hex codes
- color names

## CSS text 

***Using a font that is easy to read is important. The font adds value to your text. It is also important to choose the correct color and text size for the font.***

* @font-face : 
`allows you to use

on the computer of the person
browsing, by allowing you to
specify a path to a copy of the
font, which will be downloaded if
it is not on the user's machine.`

* font-weight : 
`font-weight property
allows you to create bold text. `

* font-style: `If you want to create italic text,
you can use the font-style
