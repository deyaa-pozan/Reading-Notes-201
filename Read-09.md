# Form 

An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing.

## Why Forms?

The best known form on the web is probably
the search box that sits right in the middle of
Google's homepage.

## How Forms Work
A user fills in a form and then presses a button
to submit the information to the server.

A form may have several form controls, each
gathering different information. The server
needs to know which piece of inputted data
corresponds with which form element.

- Form Structure :-

  - form : 
  `Form controls live inside a
form element. This element
should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a
method and id attribute too.`
  

  - action :
   `Every <form> element requires
an action attribute. Its value
is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the
information in the form when it
is submitted.`

  - method : 
  `Forms can be sent using one of
two methods: get or post.`

-----------------

- Input :-

  - Text Input :
  `The <input> element is used
to create several different form
controls. The value of the type
attribute determines what kind
of input they will be creating`


  - Password Input :
  `type="password"
When the type attribute has
a value of password it creates
a text box that acts just like a
single-line text input, except
the characters are blocked out.
They are hidden in this way so
that if someone is looking over
the user's shoulder, they cannot
see sensitive data such as
passwords.`

  - Text area :
  `The <textarea> element
is used to create a mutli-line
text input. Unlike other input
elements this is not an empty
element. It should therefore have
an opening and a closing tag. `

# Evant

Events are fired to notify code of "interesting changes" that may affect code execution. These can arise from user interactions such as using a mouse or resizing a window, changes in the state of the underlying environment (e.g. low battery or media events from the operating system), and other causes.


Here is a selection of the events that occur in the browser while you are
browsing the web. Any of these events can be used to trigger a function
in your JavaScript code.
