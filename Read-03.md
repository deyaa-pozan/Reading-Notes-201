### There are three typs of lists in html:

* Ordered lists
`An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.`

* unordered lists
`An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.`

* Definition lists
`are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms.`

### Boxes css 

- Content : `The content of the box, where text and images appear`
- Padding : `Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent`
- Border : `A border that goes around the padding and content`
- Margin :`Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent`


***Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the element, so the element can sit next to other elements.***



### Javascript 

#### Array 
`An array is a special type of variable. It does not
just store one value; it stores a list of values.`

#### if Statement

`Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.`

#### Switch 

This is how it works:

* The switch expression is evaluated once.
* The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
* If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
* If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

### JavaScript Loops
`Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.`

#### Different Kinds of Loops:


* for - loops through a block of code a number of times
* for/in - loops through the properties of an object
* for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
* while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
* do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
