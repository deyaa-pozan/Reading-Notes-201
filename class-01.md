# Extra Markup :

### `<!-- -->` :
 `If you want to add a comment
to your code that will not be
visible in the user's browser, you
can add the text between these
characters:`

### `ID Attribute` :
 `Every HTML element can carry
the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element
from other elements on the
page`

### Class Attribute :
`Every HTML element can
also carry a class attribute.
Sometimes, rather than uniquely
identifying one element within
a document`

### Block Elements :
`Some elements will always
appear to start on a new line in
the browser window. These are
known as block level elements.

Examples of block elements are
h1, p, ul, and li.`

### Inline Elements:
`Some elements will always
appear to continue on the
same line as their neighbouring
elements. These are known as
inline elements.
Examples of inline elements are
a, b, em, and img.`

# Process & Design

### CSS Properties : 
`CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.`


### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

* External CSS
* Internal CSS
* Inline CSS
