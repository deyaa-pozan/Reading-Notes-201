# *Java Script Summerization:*


* DT of vsriables:
  * Numiric: it involves the numbers.
  * String: it invoves anything between qutations.
  * boolean: which is either `true` or `false`.
  * and *arrays*, *objects* and `*null*`.
* *comments* to explain what your code does. And it is to types:
  1. Multi-Line : `/* any comment*/`
  2. Single-Line : `// any line of code`
* Variable is a place where the information being stored.
* The default value of the variable before defining is ***undefined***

* Each opened `(`,`"`,`'`,`{` should has a closing part similar to it.
* To escape the jub of qutations or similar things we can use  `\` for that.
#### To determine which path to take:
  1. EVALUATIONS You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results. 
  2. DECISIONS: Using the results ofevaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down. 
  3. LOOPS
There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly. 
* Logical operators return `true` or `false`.
  * They are used to compare the result of more than one comparison operator.
  * Those operators are: 
    - `&&` : logical AND; only when both operands is true the result become true.
    - `||`: Logical Or; one of the operands is true the result will be true.
    - `!`: logical not; the oposite vallue.
